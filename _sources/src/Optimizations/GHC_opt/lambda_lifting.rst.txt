`Lambda Lifting`
================

Lambda Lifting :cite:p:`lambdaLifting` is a classic rewriting technique that
that avoids excess closure allocations. It avoids closure allocation by moving
local functions to the global scope of the program, and by adding parameters to
the function definition to capture free variables. Thus, when a lifted function
is called no heap allocation is needed because the lifted function no longer
contains closures, rather it only references global names.

A Working Example
-----------------

Consider the following program [#f1]_:

.. code-block:: haskell

   f :: Int -> Int -> Int
   f a 0 = a
   f a n = f (g (n `mod` 2)) (n - 1)
     where
       g 0 = a
       g n = 1 + g (n - 1)

The function ``f`` defines one local function, ``g``, which appears as a free
variable in ``f``. Similarly, the variable ``a`` is a free variable in ``g``. A
lambda lifted ``g``, will convert all free variables in ``g`` to parameters.
Thus |glift| turns into:

.. code-block:: haskell

   g_lifted a 0 = a
   g_lifted a n = 1 + g (n - 1)

Now ``a`` is an input, which means that |glift| can be floated out of ``f``
to the top level producing the final program:

.. code-block:: haskell

   g :: Int -> Int -> Int
   g_lifted a 0 = a
   g_lifted a n = 1 + g (n - 1)

   f :: Int -> Int -> Int
   f a 0 = a
   f a n = f (g_lifted a (n `mod` 2)) (n - 1)

This new program will be much faster because ``f`` becomes essentially
non-allocating. Before the lambda lifting transformation ``f`` had to allocate a
closure for ``g`` in order to pass ``a`` to ``g``. After the lambda lifting on
``g`` this is no longer the case; |glift| is a top level function so ``f`` can
simply reference it; no closures needed!

.. note::

   The fundamental tradeoff is decreased heap allocation for an increase in
   function parameters at each call site. This means that lambda lifting trades
   heap for stack and is not always a performance win. See `When to Manually
   Apply Lambda Lifting`_ for guidance on recognizing when your program may
   benefit.


How Lambda Lifting Works in GHC
-------------------------------

GHC does have a lambda lifting pass in STG, however lambda lifting is not the
default method GHC uses for handling local functions and free variables.
Instead, GHC uses an alternative strategy called :term:`Closure Conversion`,
which creates more uniformity at the cost of extra heap allocation.

Automated lambda lifting in GHC occurs *late* in the compiler pipeline at STG,
right before code generation. GHC lambda lifts at STG instead of Core because
lambda lifting interferes with other optimizations.

Lambda lifting in GHC is also *Selective*. GHC uses a cost model that calculates
hypothetical heap allocations a function will induce. GHC lists heuristics for
when *not* to lambda lift in `Note [When to lift]
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/blob/master/compiler/GHC/Stg/Lift/Analysis.hs#L46>`_
, we repeat the basic ideas here. See :cite:t:`selectiveLambdaLifting`, and the
`lambda lifting wiki
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/late-lam-lift>`_ entry for more
details.

GHC does not lambda lift:

#. :term:`Top-level` bindings. By definition these
   cannot be lifted.
#. :term:`Thunk` and Data Constructors. Lifting either of these would destroy
   sharing.
#. :term:`Join Point` because there is no lifting possible in a join point.
   Similarly, abstracting over join points destroys the join point by turning it
   into an argument to a lifted function.
#. Any local :term:`known function`. This would turn a known function call into
   an :term:`unknown function` call, which is slower. The flag
   ``-fstg-lift-lams-known`` disables this restriction and enables lifting of
   known functions.
#. Any function whose lifted form would have a higher arity than the available
   number of registers for the function's calling convention. See flags
   ``-fstg-lift-(non)rec-args(-any)``
#. Any function whose lifted form will result in *closure grawth*. Closure
   growth occurs when formerly free variables, that are now additional
   arguments, did not previously occur in the closure, thereby increasing
   allocations. This is especially bad for :term:`multi-shot` lambdas which will
   allocate many times.


Observing the Effect of Lambda Lifting
--------------------------------------

You may directly observe the effect of late lambda lifting by comparing Core to
STG when late lambda lifting is enabled. You can also directly disable or enable
late lambda lifting with the flags ``-f-stg-lift-lams`` and
``-fno-stg-lift-lams``. In general, lambda lifting performs the following
syntactic changes:

#. It eliminates a let binding.
#. It creates a new :term:`Top-level` binding.
#. It replaces all occurrences of the lifted function in the let's body with a
   partial application. For example, all occurrences of ``f`` are replaced with
   ``$lf b`` in the let's body.
#. All non-top-level variables (i.e., free variables) in the let's body become
   occurrences of parameters.

When to Manually Lambda Lifting
-------------------------------

GHC does a good job finding beneficial instances of lambda lifting. However, you
might want to manually lambda lift to save compile time, or to increase
the performance of your without relying on GHC's optimizer.

There are three considerations you should have when deciding when to manually
lambda lift:

1. Are the functions that would be lifted in hot loops.
2. How many more parameters would be passed to these functions.
3. Would this transformation sacrifice readability and maintainability.

Let's take these in order: (1) lambda lifting trades heap (the let bindings that
it removes), for stack (the increased function parameters). Thus it is not
always a performance win and in some cases can be a performance loss. The losses
occur when existing closures grow as a result of the lambda lift. This extra
allocation slows the program down and increases pressure on the garbage
collector. Consider this example from :cite:t:`selectiveLambdaLifting`:

.. code-block:: haskell

   -- unlifted.

   -- f's increases heap because it must have a closure that includes the 'x'
   -- and 'y' free variables

   -- 'g' increases heap because of the let and must have 'f' and 'x' in its
   -- closure (not assuming other optimizations such as constant propagation)

   -- 'h' increases heap because 'f' is free in 'h'

   let f a b = a + x + b + y
       g d   = let h e = f e e
               in h x
   in g 1 + g 2 + g 3

Let's say we lift ``f``, now we have:


.. code-block:: haskell

   -- lifted f

   f_lifted x y a b = a + x + b + y

   let g d   = let h e = f_lifted x y e e
               in h x
   in g 1 + g 2 + g 3

``f_lifted`` is now a top level function, thus any closure that contained ``f``
before the lift will save one slot of memory. With ``f_lifted`` we additionally
save two slots of memory because ``x`` and ``y`` are now parameters. Thus
``f_lifted`` does not need to allocate a closure with :term:`Closure
Conversion`. ``g``'s allocations do not change since ``f_lifted`` can be
directly referenced just as before and because ``x`` is still free in ``g``.
Thus ``g``'s closure will contain ``x`` and ``f_lifted`` will be inlined, same
as ``f`` in the unlifted version. ``h``'s allocations grow by one slot since
``y`` *is now also* free in ``h``, just as ``x`` was. So it would seem that in
total lambda lifting ``f`` saves one slot of memory because two slots were lost
in ``f`` and one was gained in ``h``. However, ``g`` is a :term:`multi-shot`
lambda, thus ``h`` will be allocated *for each* call of ``g``, whereas ``f`` and
``g`` are only allocated once. Therefore the lift is a net loss.

This example illustrates how tricky good lifts can be and especially for hot
loops. In general, you should try to train your eye to determine when to
manually lift. Try to roughly determine allocations by counting the ``let``
expressions, the number of free variables, and the likely number of times a
function is called and allocated.

.. note::

   Recall, due to closure conversion GHC allocates one slot of memory for each
   free variable. Local functions are allocated *once per call* of the enclosing
   function. Top level functions are always only allocated once.

The next determining factor is counting the number of new parameters that will
be passed to lifted function. Should this number become greater than the number
of available argument registers on the target platform then you'll incur slow
downs in the STG machine......

Summary
-------

#. Lambda lifting is a classic optimization technique for compiling local
   functions and removing free variables.
#. Lambda lifting trades heap for stack and is therefore effective for tight,
   closed, hot loops where fetching from the heap would be slow.
#. GHC automatically performs lambda lifting, but does so only selectively. This
   transformation is late in the compilation pipeline at STG and right before
   code generation. GHC's lambda lifting transformation can be toggled via the
   ``-f-stg-lift-lams`` and ``-fno-stg-lift-lams`` flags.
#. To tell if your program has undergone lifting you can compare the Core with
   the STG. Or, you may compare STG with and without lifting explicitly enabled.
