<p>This chapter presents a recipe for debugging performance regressions in Haskell.
Often, when we debug code, it becomes too easy to begin shotgun debugging; we
apply a bunch of best-guess changes and retest to see if our stimulus induced a
response. You should do your best to avoid these urges. Instead, a more
effective method is to use a scientific approach, and develop a hypothesis and
conceptual model of how the bug manifested. Every bug or performance regression
is a learning opportunity and should be considered as such. By treating
regressions as learning opportunities, you gain knowledge of your system, the
quality of its design, and how the system interacts with its environment. But
more importantly you become a better software engineer. This chapter provides a
guide to aid you in debugging performance regression. We base it off of David
Agan’s <a class="reference external" href="https://debuggingrules.com/">9 Rules for Debugging</a> book <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id14" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and
apply his insights to Haskell programs.</p>
<section id="vocabulary">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.4.1. </span>Vocabulary<a class="headerlink" href="#vocabulary" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, we use the following vocabulary to describe aspects of
our optimization journey. Because these do not have a formal definition, we
present them here instead of in the <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#glossary"><span class="std std-ref">Glossary</span></a>:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><em>The system</em>: The system is the entire computational edifice that you’re
constructing. This includes your operating system, your CPU, your memory
controller and the program that you have written.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The program</em>: The program is the program we are trying to optimize that runs
on the system.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The problem</em> or <em>the bug</em>: The problem is an observable phenomenon of the
program. It is the performance regression we are trying to characterize,
understand, fix and prevent.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The failure mode</em>: The failure mode is the sequence of interactions between
sub-systems or external systems and your system that manifest the problem.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The baseline</em>: The baseline is the observable, measurable behavior of the
program which constitutes <em>normal and acceptable operation</em>. This what you
compare with to know you have a problem.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="the-goal">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.4.2. </span>The Goal<a class="headerlink" href="#the-goal" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have two goals when debugging. First, we wish to repair <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id15" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> our system as
fast as possible. Second, and more importantly, we wish to gain a deeper
understanding of our system. The value communicated by the second goal far
outweighs the first. By taking the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding,
we are empowering ourselves <em>and</em> everyone who reads our documentation to write
<em>more effective</em> code in the future. Ideally this translates to preventing
regressions before they can manifest, which will always cost less engineering
time and resources than reacting to regressions after they occur.</p>
<p>The best way to achieve these goals is, paradoxically, to work slowly,
contemplatively and deliberately. By working deliberately, you can ensure that
your debugging is making progress and can rigorously test your mental model of
the system. Changes to your code should verify that your mental model is either
correct or incorrect.</p>

<section id="agan-s-rules-of-debugging">
<h2><span class="section-number">1.4.3. </span>Agan’s Rules of Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#agan-s-rules-of-debugging" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are nine rules, ordered from most important to least. We’ll take them one
by one and relate each to Haskell. Note that we do not repeat <em>all</em> of Agan’s
advice, only the central ideas and how they relate to Haskell. This way all
readers will still benefit from Agan’s work, which we strongly encourage.</p>
<section id="understand-the-system">
<span id="id3"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.4.3.1. </span>Understand the System<a class="headerlink" href="#understand-the-system" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To debug, optimize, iterate and improve, you must understand the current system,
otherwise how will you know if the system is operating correctly and therefore
if your performance is real <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id16" id="id4" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> . Furthermore,
not knowing the system will limit the optimizations that you will be able to
conceive and implement.</p>
<p>Understanding the system is challenging for a high-level language such as
Haskell and is often a barrier to optimizing and debugging performance of
Haskell code. For example, GHC might surprise you by not inlining a particular
function and therefore a cascade of optimizations have not taken place.</p>
<p>Fear not, this is why this book exists. For our purposes, learning the system
means understanding your program, how GHC compiles your program, and likely some
aspects of GHC itself. Note that this is not unique to Haskell. If one were
trying to optimize a C program they would need to understand the program, its
interaction with whichever C compiler, and perhaps the interaction with the
operating system or even the CPU caches depending on the optimizations they
desire to implement and their performance goals.</p>
<p>This book cannot help you learn your own program, but it can help you learn GHC.
To understand the system, begin with learning to read the intermediate
representations of your program such as <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Core_Profiling/core.html#reading-core"><span class="std std-ref">Core</span></a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Stg_RTS_Profiling/stg.html#reading-stg"><span class="std std-ref">Stg</span></a>. Reading the intermediate representations are prerequisites for
understanding the <a class="reference internal" href="../Optimizations/GHC_opt/index.html#ghc-optimizations"><span class="std std-ref">GHC Optimizations</span></a> that GHC performs
which make Haskell so fast; and so slow when they do not fire.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-it-fail">
<span id="id5"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.4.3.2. </span>Make it Fail<a class="headerlink" href="#make-it-fail" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To make it fail, means to identify and have control over a stimulus that
<em>induces</em> incorrect system behavior. This is the phase where one is searching
for a small program, called a <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-Reproducer"><span class="xref std std-term">reproducer</span></a>, that induces the malformed
behavior. A reproducer is imperative because it gives control and a litmus test.
With a reproducer one can observe the problem <em>at will</em> and repeatedly test the
bug to determine when it is fixed in preparation for a repair.</p>
<p>In Haskell, the search for a reproducer is no different than in any other
language. Try to start from a known state <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id17" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>4<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>; use the exact hardware and software
if possible. The closer the hardware and software matches, the less variables
you have to consider. Then, try to automate as much as possible with a script. A
script pays dividends in the long run. It details the exact sequence of events
that produces the bug and leaves out any guess work. You should expect to run
the reproducer numerous times over weeks and months in the worst case and a
script will help you keep things tidy and controlled.</p>
</section>
<section id="don-t-think-look">
<span id="id7"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.4.3.3. </span>Don’t Think, Look<a class="headerlink" href="#don-t-think-look" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Of all of Agan’s rules, this is the rule that Haskellers struggle to do the most
often. We enjoy thinking with types and abstractions rather than instrumentation
and measurement. To don’t think, look means to check the instrumentation or add
instrumentation to check, and then use the instrumentation to confirm or reject
your hypothesis. Measurement, and observation will be faster on average than
<a class="reference internal" href="../glossary.html#term-Shotgun-Debugging"><span class="xref std std-term">shotgun debugging</span></a> unless you are very lucky (which of course is not
reliable).</p>
<p>So what is our instrumentation? We can directly observe by reading the
intermediate representations such as <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Core_Profiling/core.html#reading-core"><span class="std std-ref">Core</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Stg_RTS_Profiling/stg.html#reading-stg"><span class="std std-ref">Stg</span></a>, or <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Cmm_Profiling/cmm.html#reading-cmm"><span class="std std-ref">Cmm</span></a>. Reading the intermediate
representations works well if you suspect an optimization is not firing; which
can often happen during upgrades of GHC or dependencies. Or we can use a probe
to inspect the system. The available probes range across the entire Haskell
software stack, from binary probes, such as <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Binary_Profiling/linux_perf.html#perf-chapter"><span class="std std-ref">perf</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Binary_Profiling/valgrind.html#valgrind-chapter"><span class="std std-ref">valgrind</span></a>, to GHC provided probes such as
<a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Haskell_Profiling/eventlog.html#eventlog-chapter"><span class="std std-ref">eventlog</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/Stg_RTS_Profiling/ghc_debug.html#ghc-debug-chapter"><span class="std std-ref">GHC-debug</span></a>.
Note that there is no best probe, rather the right probe will depend on the bug
and your exact situation. For example, using eventlog to inspect your program’s
heap is typically the first check of instrumentation if you suspect a memory
leak.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference internal" href="../Measurement_Observation/index.html#mpo"><span class="std std-ref">Measurement, Profiling, and Observation</span></a> for a complete
list of instrumentation.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you know which instrumentation to use and how to interpret its output,
search its output until you identify a handful of causes and have at least one
failure mode hypothesis to test. Remember that you are not observing <em>the bug</em>
with the instrumentation, rather you are observing <em>the effect</em> of the bug in
order to formulate a hypothesis. For example, with a memory leak, the bug’s
effect could be a high amount of memory usage reported by GHC, or your operating
system, or a pyramid shaped heap profile. For a missed optimization, the effect
could be redundant boxing or a missed rule that produces poor performing Core,
and consequently a higher Mutator time reported by the RTS.</p>

<section id="divide-and-conquer">
<span id="id8"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.4.3.4. </span>Divide and Conquer<a class="headerlink" href="#divide-and-conquer" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Imagine the system execution as an ordered linear sequence of causal events
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{0} \rightarrow \ldots{} \rightarrow e_{halt}\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{0}\)</span> is
the first event to take place and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{halt}\)</span> the last. When the system has
a bug, the sequence of events, also called a causal chain, diverges from its
expected behavior at some event, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{bug}\)</span>. In this view, debugging is
searching the causal chain for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{bug}\)</span>. Thus, to divide and conquer
means to search the causal chain with the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm">divide and conquer strategy</a>.</p>
<p>To divide and conquer the causal chain, start with the anomalous end. Think of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{bug}\)</span> as a pivot point, after the bug the chain is: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{bug}
\rightarrow \ldots{} \rightarrow e_{halt}\)</span> and the system is in an anomalous
operating state, before the bug: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{0} \rightarrow \ldots{} \rightarrow
e_{bug-1}\)</span> the system is in an acceptable operating state. So if we start from
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{0}\)</span> then we must verify the system state at every event <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{0}
\ldots e_{bug-1}\)</span> <em>on all possible</em> control flow branches. That is a lot of work
(and is better left to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)">assertions</a> ). However,
by beginning the search on the anomalous side we only have to find <em>one</em>
anomalous state on <em>one</em> branch to begin to work backwards to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{bug}\)</span>.
Thus, searching from the anomalous end is faster because there are less possible
system states to check.</p>
<p>A good tactic to make the search for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{bug}\)</span> easier is to exacerbate the
effect of the bug, or in the word’s of David Agan: “Make it obvious.”. Our
Haskell programs, like all programs, obey this causal chain. But Haskell is a
pure lazy language, so the causal chain forms via data dependency rather than
forming via the observable ordering of side-effects <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id18" id="id9" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>. This simplifies
debugging because we control the data and therefore the causal chain. So by
changing the input to the system, we can make the rough location of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(e_{bug}\)</span> more obvious. Making the bug’s effect obvious can be as simple
as making the load on the system larger. For example, imagine trying to optimize
the Fibonacci function, instead of testing with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fib</span> <span class="pre">10</span></code> one can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fib</span>
<span class="pre">200</span></code> to exacerbate memory or runtime issues. This will create a larger response
signal in the instrumentation which is easier to find, diagnose and analyze.</p>
<p>A similar method is to input data that has an easily recognizable pattern. This
technique is useful when reading Core, Stg, or Cmm. GHC generates names based on
user provided names and keeps the original names in the intermediate
representations. For example, consider this code</p>

<p>To some extent, everyone understands that changing only one thing at a time is
good practice. It simplifies keeping a log of changes, correlating cause and
effect, and more importantly, it reduces the probability of creating an abnormal
system. Every change to the system has a chance to move that system’s operation
from inside the system’s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_tolerance">engineering tolerance</a> (the expected range of
operation) to outside; into new and unexplored operating conditions. By changing
only one thing at a time we mitigate this risk while debugging.</p>
<p>Doing this on a Haskell code base will be identical to any other programming
environment; Haskell is not unique here. But we have two recommendations: first,
make sure you have a baseline, a working master copy, so that you can always
compare your working copy to it. Second, if you begin changing lots of parts of
the system semi-randomly (such as adding a bunch of strictness) to check if
these changes affect the bug’s effect, then you are guessing, and instead should

<span id="id11"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.4.3.6. </span>Keep an Audit Trail<a class="headerlink" href="#keep-an-audit-trail" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To keep an audit trail means to maintain a log of your debugging work. Think
like a scientist who wants others to be able to replicate their work. Be
meticulous, you should write down the exact sequence of what you did, and then
what and how much happened. You should write your log as if you would return to
it years or months later. You should record your theories. Theories are the
background context that informed your change; <em>the reason</em>, <em>the why</em> that you
made the change you did. In addition, record the commands you ran, how you first
observed the bug’s effect, the instrumentation you used to monitor the bug’s
effect and what you expected to observe from a change. A good log should tell a
story; it should read like the laboratory journal of a scientist or engineer.
Lastly, if the effect of the bug is some special piece of output, then be sure
to include it so that you create a searchable document, you’re future self will
be thankful.</p>
<p>An example log might look something like this:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In the example, I use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code>  as meta-variables that stand for a
subsystem or test. Similarly, I use angle-bracket notation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;...&gt;</span></code> to
represent pieces of important data that the log should record.</p>

  ** Bug&#39;s Effect:

     - We&#39;ve observed in increase of &lt;n&gt; seconds (&lt;m&gt; %) in Mutator time as
     reported by the RTS&#39;s -S flag when running test foo on debian 10 at
     commit &lt;hash&gt; in CI.

  ** Background:

     Test foo is memory intensive, testing a pathological case where user
     input results is subsystem bar performing a lot of IO operations
     concurrently.

  ** Sanity Checks:

     - Do we observe this regression on other platforms, e.g., Windows,
       Fedora or Mac?

     - Has the CI runner changed?

  ** Theory: Regression caused by missed optimizations resulting in a GHC
  version bump that occurred at commit &lt;hash&gt;.

  *** Possible Instrumentation

     - Compare Mutator time with the baseline using -O0. I expect to see the
       baseline and regressed versions perform similarly at -O0. If that is
       the case then we should disable the optimizations implied by -O1 one
       by one. Why -O1? Because that is -O2 with two less passes of GHC&#39;s
       optimizer. If that is not the case, then we should check versioning
       differences and bisect the commits to find the commit where the
       mutator regresses. In this scenario it is likely that we&#39;ve slowed the
       system rather than some interaction with GHC. We could also check for
       a stack leak in this case.

     - Revert to known working GHC version, then run test foo on debian 10 at
       commit we observed the bug. If we observe the bug&#39;s effect then we
       know its a regression that in our code base. If not then its a
       regression in a dependency and we can systematically test each one.

     - Inspect the tickyticky output to compare the baseline and regressed
       branch. Check for a change in the number of unboxed tuples and data
       constructors. Unsure how stable these numbers are between runs of the
       same test.

     - Compare the output of the baseline branch and the regressed branch
       when compiling with `-Wall-missed-specializations`. Changes in this
       output could point to missed specializations which would also be
       observable in Core. However, this output also changes along dependency
       versioning. I expect to see minor differences in the output. If these
       differences occur in the code the foo exercises then they are likely
       candidates for the regression. Will have to verify by reading Core.

  *** Tests

     - Compare Mutator time with baseline version using -O0:
         Note taken on [2021-12-03 Fri 15:55]

         With `ghc --version`: 9.8.1

         Ran `cabal
         test --show-details=streaming --pattern=&#39;foo&#39; --ghc-options=&#39;+RTS -S
         -RTS&#39;` on both baseline (commit &lt;hash&gt;) and regressed (commit
         &lt;hash&gt;). Results differed by less than 1%.

<span id="id12"></span><h3><span class="section-number">1.4.3.7. </span>Check the Plug<a class="headerlink" href="#check-the-plug" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>To check the plug means to verify your assumptions by performing sanity checks.
Assumptions could be library and GHC versions, your operating systems’ available
resources and settings; such as the CPU governor (be sure to make sure your
laptop is plugged in). But assumptions can also be environmental, for example,
the input data is what you expect, or that you are working from the commit you
expect to be working from.</p>
<p>Checking the plug enables one to divide and conquer. Without checking the plug,
the anomalous region of the system’s causal chain is the whole chain! So make
sure you take the time to check the plug. To check the plug, start at the
beginning of the causal chain; check the tools, the dependencies, the inputs and
default settings; as David Agan states: “Many anomalous systems are created by
default settings.”</p>
<p>Ideally you would check the plug at the beginning of your investigation so that
your investigation does not proceed with bad assumptions. Another time to check
the plug is when your investigation has led you into contradiction. This happens
when you follow two hypotheses that are both confirmed with testing, but which
contradict each other. This is typically an indication that something is
egregiously wrong, and that the system you are inspecting is far outside its
engineering tolerances. Such deviations are more times than not (but not
always!) caused by unplugged things in the system.</p>

<p>Sometimes, despite your best efforts you’ll exhaust all leads and become stuck.
To get a fresh view, means to recognize when you’re stuck and ask for help,
especially from experts.</p>
<p>The value in asking for help is a new perspective on the problem. The new
perspective may highlight features of the problem that you missed or overlooked,
and often times describing and explaining the issue to another person can lead
you to new insights.</p>
<p>When asking for help, do not communicate your theories, instead communicate the
symptoms you’ve observed. If you communicate your theories then you’ll
inevitably lead your interlocutor down the path your investigation took; you’ll
accidentally coerce them to your perspective. So resist the temptation, allow
them to come to their own conclusions and formulate their own theories.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Haskell ecosystem is full of enthusiastic, helpful people from
all over the world. Don’t be afraid to participate! The worst case outcome is no
one responds, the best case is that you connect with others who share your
passion and help you fix the problem. Here are the best forums to reach out:</p>

<p>Repeat it with me: “The problem will not fix itself nor will the system correct
itself.” We wish it were otherwise, but the cost of inaction almost always
outweighs the cost of action because inaction prevents quality control.</p>
<p>So once you have a fix in mind how do you know it will correct the system? You
check. You must <a class="reference internal" href="#don-t-think-look"><span class="std std-ref">Don’t Think, Look</span></a>! To verify that the fix corrects the
system, toggle the fix on and off, and observe if the toggle also toggles the
bug’s effect. If the bug’s effect also toggles then you should have high
confidence that you’ve found a fix because you can now affect the bug at will,
and therefore you have regained control of the system.</p>
<p>Control of the system is crucial; if you do not regain control, then you cannot
be sure the bug will not manifest again and have lost some understanding of what
the system is. In other words, it is only with control of the system that you
are able to make correctness and performance guarantees to your end-users.
Furthermore, it is only with control that you can begin to craft a repair,
complete with instrumentation to capture more system details for next time.</p>

</ol>
<p>Why do we follow these rules? Because doing so is more efficient than shotgun
debugging, guessing, or living with a buggy system. Recall our goals: in the
short term, to repair the system; and in the long term, to gain a deeper
understanding of the system. We are thinking on a time scale of years. On that
time scale bugs are inevitable. By gaining a deeper understanding of the system
we slowly master the system. Mastering the system, in turn, enables more
efficient, better engineered systems, more communicative documentation, and the
ability to avoid future bugs <em>before</em> they manifest. So work slowly,
deliberately and carefully. The investment pays off in the long run.</p>

strictness on a programming language’s semantics from the perspective of
a compiler. The essential idea is that a program is a specification of
behavior, which from the purview of a compiler is a set of constraints
that dictate the observable behavior of the program. From this
perspective, a strict evaluation strategy introduces synthetic
dependencies between every statement in a program which then dictates the
evaluation order. In contrast, a lazy evaluation strategy imposes no such
synthetic dependencies, thereby allowing data dependencies in the program
to dictate the evaluation order and allowing the compiler to perform more
optimizations.</p>
